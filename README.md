- This is a Social Media i built with Mastodon's API's<br>
- There's an explore page with public posts but I've implemented my own data science that filters the good and interesting posts from the bad ones.<br>
- I've implemented Pagination on the backend and Infinite Scrolling on the frontend and set up event listeners that automatically fetch in the background while you're scrolling so that the user never has to wait for posts to fetch.
